Computational Optimization/ low rank matrix completion theory

Abstract:

The main topic is data reconstruction based on incomplete inter-point distance. In this project, given less than 4 percentage of the total original data which contains the distance between any two points on the surface of a 3D object, then recover the complete matrix from the given data using the low-rank matrix completion theory. To complete the goal, singular value thresholding (SVT) algorithm is used in this project. This paper is an explanation of the algorithm as well as the results.
